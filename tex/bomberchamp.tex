\section{Summary and Improvements}
% improvements: distributional DQN, train for 3 months

% improvement of game setup: j
% - make provided framework easy to use
% -- currently main.py, settings.py and possibly callbacks.py has to be changed for a simple switch between train and test mode
% -- separate rendering and environment, so that the environment can be called from e.g. a jupyter notebook
% -- provide main.py or python notebook

\section{Training process}


\subsection{Centring of the agent}
To simplify learning for our agent, it was centred on the board, so that it stays at a fixed position while the environment (coins, crates, other agents) move around it. This is very common in the Atari games on which most implementations of DQN agents are tested, including the Rainbow agent without distributional reinforcement learning from which we took most of our initial hyper parameters. Therefore we thought, a more similar setting would be beneficial to our agent. To implement this, the size of the board was increased to four times its original size and the agent placed in the middle of the new board.
\subsection{Self play}
%TODO how was it implemented etc
For training purposes a simple agent implementation that follows the rules of bomberman and plays reasonably well was provided.
To exploit this we wanted to first train our agent by classifying inputs generated with the simple agents. %TODO why didn't this work?
This is why we implemented a self play strategy. This was also useful, as we could then use google colab and train more than one agent at the same time while using the same neural network.
