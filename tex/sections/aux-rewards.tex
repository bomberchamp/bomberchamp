Auxilliary rewards:
For coin collection, 


For single player with coins in crates, interestingly it did learn to destroy the crates and collect the coins pretty well with a reward for destroying crates and no penalty for death. But there were a lot of games where the agent bombed itself in the beginning.
With a penalty for death, the agent learns to avoid death by choosing WAIT. Therefore we penalize this action and the agent learns to destroy the crates and collect coins, but when run too long, it learns to alternate UP-DOWN and RIGHT-LEFT to avoid death.

depending on the crate reward, the agent may ignore coins

In multi-player, without auxilliary rewards, the agent does not learn well.
With auxilliary rewards for crates and WAIT, the agent learns well.
