As we use only movement actions for the singleplayer coin collection mode, we do not need any auxiliary reward. Starting from the singleplayer mode with coins in crates, we found that the agent does not learn well with only having coins as rewards. So we give the agent an auxiliary reward of $0.2$ for destroying crates.
Interestingly the agent does learn to destroy crates and collect coins pretty well even without a penalty for death. But there are still a lot of games where the agent bombs itself in the beginning.

With a penalty for death, the agent learns to avoid death by choosing WAIT. When penalizing this action, the resulting agent learns to destroy the crates and collect coins, but after training for a long time it learns to alternate UP-DOWN and RIGHT-LEFT as a more elaborate version of WAIT to avoid death.

So we chose to give a reward of $-0.2$ for WAIT and track the last moves $m_{t-k} = (x_{t-k}, y_{t-k}, a_{t-k})$ for $k=1,\dots,20$. The agent then gets penalized for the number of moves that are similar to the current move with
$$
R_{\text{similar\_moves}} = - \frac{1}{20} \sum_{k=1}^{20} (m_t = m_{t-k} \rightarrow 1) \land(m_t \neq m_{t-k} \rightarrow 0).
$$

For dieing the agent gets a reward of $-5$.
