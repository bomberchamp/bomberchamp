difficulties:
- nothing works
- Invalid actions -> solutions
- agent is bored (no coins in sight) -> more coins
- default reward >=0: stagnation -> changed to negative




self-play:
- randomized game settings (only coins, single player, crate_density)
- different agent types (auxiliary rewards)
- skill evaluation
- playing against self and past versions (avoid strategy collapse)
